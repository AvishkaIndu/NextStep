## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Environment file already created at server/.env
# Update these required variables:
# - MONGODB_URI (your MongoDB connection string)
# - JWT_SECRET (a secure random string)
# - CLOUDINARY_* (for file uploads - optional for testing)
```

### 2. Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system or use MongoDB Atlas.

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev:fullstack

# Or start separately:
npm run server:dev  # Backend on port 5000
npm run dev         # Frontend on port 5173
```

### 5. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

Edit `server/.env` with your settings:

```env
# Database (Required)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nextstep_dev

# JWT Security (Required)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this

# File Uploads (Optional for testing)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Email (Optional)
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Register a New User
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose role (Student or Industry Expert)
4. Fill in details and register

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","role":"student","fullName":"Test User"}'
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The application automatically creates these collections:
- **users** - Authentication and basic user info
- **profiles** - Detailed user profiles
- **achievements** - User achievements and points
- **activities** - User activity tracking

## 🔐 Security Features

- JWT authentication with secure headers
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- CORS protection
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Role-based authorization
- Secure file upload validation

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the 'dist' folder
```

### Backend (Heroku/Railway/DigitalOcean)
```bash
# Set environment variables
# Deploy the 'server' folder
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **API Docs**: Check routes in `server/routes/`
- **Components**: Check `src/components/`
- **Database Models**: Check `server/models/`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running and connection string is correct
2. **Port Conflicts**: Change ports in vite.config.ts or server/.env
3. **Environment Variables**: Restart server after changing .env file
4. **CORS Issues**: Check CLIENT_URL in server/.env

### Getting Help:
- Check console logs for detailed error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure MongoDB is accessible
